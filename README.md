# Getting-Cleaning-Data
Getting &amp; Cleaning Data - Project

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The files included are:
* README.md - covers purpose of the program and the nature of the analysis files
* run_analysis.R - the R script performing the analysis/transformations
* run_analysis.txt - the output in text format of the tidy data file
* Cookbook.md - covers the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data

## Nature of the Data
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
